1. Shapiro-Wilk normality test results for classifier 'svmClassifier' and test 'hyperparamGridSearch':

Combination 1: p = 0.0000 → Not normal
Combination 2: p = 0.0000 → Not normal

Result: At least one combination is not parametric.

2. Due to the normality test indicating non-parametric data, performing Kruskal-Wallis test for differences between parameter combinations of classifier 'svmClassifier' and test 'hyperparamGridSearch':
Result: p = 0.7882
Conclusion: No significant difference between combinations.
